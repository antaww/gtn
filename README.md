# Guess The Number

- Guess The Number is a game where you must use your logic in order to guess a 4-digit secret number selected by the computer at the beginning of the game. 
The number is formed with digits from 0 to 9; each digit appears once at most.

- This number is guessed by you via multiple attempts. 
An attempt consists in a proposed number, selected by you, and the computer's reply. 
The computer must tell you, in his reply, how many digits have you guessed on the same position, and how many digits have you guessed on a different position.

- Using information from the computer's reply, you must guess the number using as few moves as possible.
